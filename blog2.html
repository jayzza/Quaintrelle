 <h2><strong> <br> <br> <del> A Great Loser </del> </strong></h2> </font> <br> 
 
 
 <font face="trebuchet ms" align="justify">
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What a failure. You failed. Yes, you failed. Gosh you failed again. Guess what, you're a failure because you failed. I FAILED!
Well, I don't really fail, like it is really an epic fail, but it seems like I failed. This is how my mind annoys me whenever I did not succeed at doing something, setting aside the fact that I exerted a huge effort and really prepared for it. I fail on try-outs, student duties, love life?, helping others, being a responsible citizen, I fail myself. And If I fail myself even more I might fail my family and I would never want that to happen.These are the times when a motivation, a simple source of inspiration is highly needed. Moreover, everyone experienced failing at something. Ei. That is the essence of life, to fail repeatedly, reflect shortly and learn from it. I know this sounds too mainstream but at least it is true.  
How do I, a great loser, deal with this? I'm 19 now; thus, I should be able to handle failures and life's adversities with grace. I let myself feel sad. I mourn less, and cry if I feel like it, reflect, and move forward. I keep on giving myself a pat on the back. Face the music; we are all going to lose at some point or shall I say several times. Let us not dwell on our tragedies. We can't win it all. All-time winners hardly grow and learn. Do not treat loss as a failure for it is not the end. It is not a game over and a K.O. in life. Furthermore, It is like a mother who has a power to enlighten us whenever we are down and friend who manages to bring a smile on our faces. Loss is created for us to strive, aspire harder, and gather our unrealized dreams.
Im great, this I know. I'm a loser, this I know. I admit I'm one of those great losers and this helped me to be comfortable, accept my own skin, and lose unashamedly. HEY! I'm a great loser and that is not bad.

 <h2><strong> <br> <br>  Ika-nineTEEN na Nobela </strong></h2> </font> <br> 

 <font face="trebuchet ms"> <blockquote>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last teen ko na to kaya I'll open up a little about something that I was deprived of, Love life, this somehow has an impact on our teen lives.  After our afternoon sessions with DJ Noemi, ay Mam Noemi pala, na dinaig pa si Papa Jack, many things surged my mind. First, Bakit wala akong love life? Second, bakit wala akong love life? Third, BAKIT WALA? I'm an NBSB pero hindi ako bato, I admire many but I'm a downright stupid and a hopeless romantic na may huge admiration sa isa. Pero sabi nga ni Fidel sa 100 Tula Para Kay Stella, "ganun naman talaga diba kung sino ang gusto natin yun ang imposibleng mapasaatin". I'd like to share my thoughts about this just how Mam Noemi enlightened our class about right love at the wrong time. I think she's right that such love doesn't exist.  If you love someone at the wrong time hence it's wrong. I believe that just because you like someone, it doesn't mean that you have to be with him. All in good time things will go on its course. Sabi nga ni mam, "magmahal sa tamang panahon at sa tamang pagkakataon ayusin muna ang sarili." I just turned 19. I'm striving hard in my studies for my aspirations in life and I have a long long way to go. Besides, I always have my family, friends, and God with me. I'm thankful for all those people. I love them all. They're the best! Kaya haay love life it is not our time, yet. </p> 

<p> P.S. Here's my favorite quote about love, "When you lose your phone or your keys 9 out of 10 you'll find it when you stop looking. That's the same basic principle in love. Focus on improving yourself and let love run its course."

The feeling isn't unfamiliar it surged like a storm.

I feel my insides twisting, tumbling,

It is a riveting screw.

I've been here before.

This is something I'm used to and yet,

It is a fresh sting.

I guess there is no cure,

But they say time soothes all sorrows.

I've been ignoring it for quite some time now,

It just keeps on coming back.

All at once the memories surged like a storm.

I pray it won't come back.

 <h2><strong> <br> <br>  Out of Tune </strong></h2> </font> <br> 

 <font face="trebuchet ms"> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was the music that stole my heart. I sing with different colors. Red is the ephemeral sound I heard from the strings that were strummed in perfection. The music lingers in my soul, it keeps playing on my mind. It is gratifying as I'm delivered in cloud-nine. Symphony was tuneful and incredulous from an angel's voice, a euphony that's so good to hear. Until it ceased. Rueful as the melody comes to its end. Blue is the ephemeral music I heard from the last strum. The melody was all evanescent. You're the music who broke the harmony. The strings were broken, my beat was stolen and I lost my rhythm. I will find the right track.

 <h2><strong> <br> <br>  Lesson Unlearned </strong></h2> </font> <br> 

 <font face="trebuchet ms"> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm still stuck in the past, it stings. There are scars I'm still mending. Unexpectedly, you emerged like a shooting star, for a while you surpassed the light of the others. You brightened the night for a moment. Everything was quick. I was right. I've seen this before. You gave me sweet temporary moments that kept me lost in reverie. It's probably those small talks, late night conversations, the laughs I hear from you from afar, the simple joy of having someone to talk to, one who understands you, and the one who also suffers but still manage to smile. All these made me face these foolish and childish things I restrained myself from. The moments aren't like a good place you want to keep on visiting every summer. I'm tired but I kept thinking about it. I keep on shattering and mending. I'm tired but still I want to think about it. I never expected a quiet life and you came striking like a lightning. You left me in the middle of the road alone in the storm you brought. I'm still asleep. I was never astir. It was my mistake I have to accept.
